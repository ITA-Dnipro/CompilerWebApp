## User's guide
### How to run the app
To run the app simply launch it with `cargo run`.
It doesn't require anything specific, but it additionaly allows the admin to set a folder for temporary user source code and compiled binary files. To do this, specify it as command line argument when launching the app: `cargo run "dir_path"`.
This path is stored in the `COMPILATION_TEMP_DIR` environment variable:
- if it already exists when the app is launched - its existing value will be used;
- if the admin specified a value for the variable - it will be used, even if the variable already exists;
- if it doesn't exist - default path will be used: `{workspace_folder}/tempdata`. Same goes for cases when already existing value or admin specified value are not valid paths.
